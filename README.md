# Day 3: DJ-CHIP
An 8 bit sound emulator. Turns MIDI files into true 8 bit wave files with custom configs. This was a submition for Day 3 of Open Source Week

## How it works:
You can take any ``.mid`` file and when you provide the file name, you can designate all the instruments found in the midi file to be a type of retro waveform. We currently have 
1. Sine
2. Square
3. Sawtooth
4. Triangle
5. Noise

## Future Improvements:
The noise channe needs a lot of work and tweaking. In later updates, I plan to provide a soundfont that sounds much more authentic to older retro systems like the Soundblaster and old NES games.

## Contributions
Please feel free to contribute to the repo or even fork it and put your own special twist on it! I appreciate seeing membeers of the community get involved!
